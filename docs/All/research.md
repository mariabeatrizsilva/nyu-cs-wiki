# Research

Research is an interesting but unique path in CS. I would recommend reading this [article](https://web.cs.dartmouth.edu/undergraduate/graduate-school-advice) from Dartmouth's department of Computer Science to get a better idea if you would be a good fit in graduate school. If you are considering applying for a Ph.D., this [document](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol/gradschooltalk.pdf) by Mor Harchol-Balter at CMU is a very straightforward view from a professor involved in the Ph.D. admissions process at CMU, U.C. Berkeley, and MIT.

At NYU, the time commitment and goals of research will vary depending on the professor you have. For finding a professor, a straightforward way is during or after the semester taking a class with them, explain your interest in a research area that the professor also focuses on. You could alternatively meet professors who you didn't have classes with in-person or cold emails different faculty members. Additionally, you can find professors at Courant in specific research areas by using the [CS Department Faculty Page](https://cs.nyu.edu/dynamic/people/faculty/) and filtering by research interests. 

Pursuing the honors track in the CS degree at Courant also requires two semesters of reseach.
